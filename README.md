# VRChat advance for [Project Babble](https://github.com/SummerSigh/ProjectBabble) of facial tracking

- This project is an addition to [**Project Babble**](https://github.com/SummerSigh/ProjectBabble).

- Unit packages will be published to this repository to spice up your VRChat avatar

## Attention! I don't have time to write text and clean files from garbage. Within weeks, by mid-June, I will update the repository and write instructions

It will work now, but the files contain a lot of unnecessary information and disabled functions that should be removed.

## How to run 
1. Download the files, combine them with the ones already on your avatar and enjoy.

## The project is experimental, something may not work or be buggy. But these files will help you test animate the avatar.

I will add everything, but not now. In a week.
